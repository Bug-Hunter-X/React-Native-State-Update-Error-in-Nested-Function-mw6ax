# React Native State Update Issue in Nested Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development: state variables not updating correctly when accessed from within nested functions or callbacks.  The `NestedStateBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `NestedStateSolution.js` provides the solution.  The issue stems from incorrect scoping and how closures behave in JavaScript.

## Problem Description:

When state is accessed from a function nested within a component, using `this.setState` or the functional component's state update mechanism might not function as expected. This frequently leads to the UI not reflecting state changes, even if the state appears to update in the console.

## Solution:

The primary solution involves using closures effectively or utilizing React's built-in state update functions and ensuring proper scope.
